#Part 1: 
Download testscoredata.txt and read it in R
```{r import data}
scores <- 
  readr::read_table2(file = here::here("/project2/testscoredata.txt"),
                   col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(subject = factor(subject),
         sex = factor(sex))

head(scores,5)
```

Use Hotellingâ€™s T^2 test to test for a difference in the mean score vector of the boys and the mean vector of the girls. Make sure you include clear command lines and relevant output/results with hypotheses, test result(s) and conclusion(s)/interpretation(s).
```{r}
