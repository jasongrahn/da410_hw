#Use R to solve Chapter 11 Page 402: #11.9
Make sure you include the commands and outputs, as well as the interpretations of the outputs.

11.9 Use the sons data of Table 3.8.
```{r import sons data}
sons <- read.table(here::here("assignment06/T3_8_SONS.DAT"))  %>% 
  rename(y1 = V1, # head length
         y2 = V2, # head breadth
         x1 = V3, # head length
         x2 = V4) # head breadth

head(sons, 5)
```

```{r subgrouping sons}
#subgroup the data into first and second sons
first.son <- sons %>% select(y1, y2)
second.son <- sons %>% select(x1, x2)
```

```{r}
cc_output <- cca(first.son, second.son)
```

## (a) Find the canonical correlations between ($y_1$,$y_2$) and ($x_1$, $x_1$)Â·
```{r}
cc_output$corr
```

#(b) Find the standardized coefficients for the canonical variates.
```{r}
cc_output
```

#(c) Test the significance of each canonical correlation.
```{r}
F.test.cca(cc_output)
```
