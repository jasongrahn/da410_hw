9.7 c, don't need to generate classification table, just use nearest neighbor method to assign 3rd vector of both two matrix into group1 or group2. For the detail, look at the example.

You can use the data1.txt and data2.txt to read into data.

Calculate step by step (you can use R to do matrix calculation, DO NOT use knn functions), make sure to provide intermediate steps.
